        <p>1. Bank Credit Response to Corporate Disclosure Regulation</p>
        <p>Research question: <span class="normal-weight">Using supervisory bank-borrower level data from the Deutsche Bundesbank, the question to be explored in this study is whether and how bank credit responds to corporate disclosure regulation, focusing on the impact of private firm disclosure mandates on national and local bank credit in Germany.</span></p>
        <p>2. Spillover Effects of Corporate Disclosure Regulation: Evidence from German Private Firms and Counties</p>
        <p>Research question: <span class="normal-weight">Using proprietary datasets from the Deutsche Bundesbank, in this study I investigate the impact of a private firm disclosure regulation on the performance of local firms and local macroeconomic outcomes, in an attempt to provide evidence on market-wide effects from regulation, especially on local-level externalities.</span></p>

        <p>1. Exploring the Standard-Setting Process: Evidence from IFRS Comment Letters and Board Meeting Records <span class="normal-weight">(with Menghan Zhu)</span></p>        
        <p>Research question: <span class="normal-weight">In this study, we attempt to gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics between comment letters and board discussions in the IFRS standard-setting process, and to learn more in general about the behavior of politicians and regulators in the standard-setting process.</span></p>
        <p>2. The Interplay of Public and Private Information Channels: Evidence from the German Banking Sector</p>        
        <p>Research question: <span class="normal-weight">Using proprietary datasets from the Deutsche Bundesbank, in this study I aim to investigate the impact of corporate disclosure regulation on the interplay between formal (public) and informal (private) information channels in the bank’s lending decision-making process.</span></p>
        <p>3. Auditor Concentration and Product Market Competition</p>        
        <p>Research question: <span class="normal-weight">I use an unexpected audit demand shock from a German disclosure regulation as the instrument variable to investigate the impact of auditor networks on product market competition.</span></p>
        <p>4. Real Effect of ESG Over-Regulation <span class="normal-weight">((with Xinyi Huang)</span></p>        
        <p>Research question: <span class="normal-weight">The European Union has witnessed a surge in ESG regulations designed to promote sustainable and responsible business practices over the past few years. These regulations, while well-intentioned, have led to a complex and diverse landscape of requirements for firms. Given this background, the question to be explored in this study is the extent to which the complexity and diversity of ESG regulations affect corporate compliance, reporting quality and stock market response.</span></p>
        <p>5. Consumption Tax Collection Structure and Policymaker Behavior</span></p>        
        <p>Research question: <span class="normal-weight">Exploiting the varied administrative practices of each EU country in the collection of Value Added Tax (VAT), in this study I examine whether and how the consumption tax collection structure influences the behavior of policy makers in the tax policy making process.</span></p>
